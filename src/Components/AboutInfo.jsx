        I started my journey in game development with Unity and Godot, where I
        learned to blend creativity and code. From there, I moved into app
        development, building tools that are both functional and user-friendly.
        During my time as a Master's student at Brooklyn College, I focused on
        web development, bringing together my experience in games and apps to
        create modern, scalable projects.
